# Hi, I'm barmiedev ðŸ‘¾

ðŸ‘‹ Full-stack dev, solo founder, digital provocateur.  
ðŸŽ¸ Building software for the messy, magical world of music.

> Doing IT for music

I build in public â€” the ideas, the breakdowns, the breakthroughs.  

Here youâ€™ll find:
- music-focused tools & prototypes
- experiments that donâ€™t fit the mold
- documentation for the journey, not just the product

---
ðŸ§ª Follow the noise, not the hype.
